## React Job Tracker

This is a simple Job Tracker with the ability to create, edit, and delete job applications.
The user enters information about their job applications including, company, title, current application status, etc.
The project uses React State to store data and render it to the page.
The project uses a modal as the page/form for both creating and editting applications
